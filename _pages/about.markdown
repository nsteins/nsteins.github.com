I am a data scientist and designer working at [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com) in Chicago and occasional [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org) volunteer. 

I'm interested in using data and simulations to grok systemic challenges and solutions. I want to help build a better and more equitable world, particularly one that isn't completely ravaged by the devastating effects of climate change. I regularly organize as part of [Democratize ComEd](https://demcomed.org/) for a clean, affordable and democratically-controlled electric utility in Chicago. I occasionally write [blog posts](/posts) on climate related topics as I am learning about them.

At IDEO, I apply data science and design thinking at all stages of the innovation timeline, from identifying new opportunities to building prototypes and launching pilots. In my previous life, I completed a PhD in physics, where I performed experiments shooting lasers at [diamonds](https://phys.org/news/2016-06-tiny-diamonds-enable-huge-advances.html). 

### Art
I also make art and music that has nothing to do with data or science:
