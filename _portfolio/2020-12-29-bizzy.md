I worked with a team interaction and software designers to design the user interface and run a live pilot for a sales forecasting tool in several restaurants, iterating on the design and model based on our field research with managers. I developed and tested the timeseries forecasting model including external weather and event data. This pilot has since been developed into a full venture that has launched in the market
