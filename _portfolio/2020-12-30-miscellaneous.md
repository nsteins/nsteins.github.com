## Dreamzine Cordelia
Collaborating with a graphic designer, I built an [immersive web site](https://agitated-einstein-5a9a0a.netlify.app/) using Tone.js to create a procedurally generated audio-visual relaxation and sound healing experience.

## Bob Ross Roulette
Using Flask, Vue and socket.io, I built a [real time multiplayer web game](https://bob-ross-roulette.herokuapp.com/#/) where players can gamble on what will happen in a randomly chosen episode of Bob Ross.
