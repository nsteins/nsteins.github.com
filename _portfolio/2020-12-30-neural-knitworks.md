Using a dataset of punchcard knitting machine patterns, I trained a neural network to synthesize new patterns. My [coworker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allahale/) knit a sweater using these patterns and wrote about the experience.

[You can see the finished product here](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/AlkaPalka/neural-knitworks-sweater)
