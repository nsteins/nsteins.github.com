I trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) using Tensorflow to build a laugh-o-meter and prototyped two modes of interaction from a Fitbit-like dashboard to a reactive mood light.

[I wrote about the process of developing the machine learning model and designing the prototypes for the IDEO blog.](https://www.ideo.com/blog/why-your-office-needs-a-laugh-detector)
