I created an agent based model simulation using real census and street map data to help a large vehicle manufacturer explore the future of commercial services empowered by AVs. Using census data to simulate customer demand and [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/) to simulate real routing, I helped to explore how different vehicle properties (size, speed) and logistics strategies would translate to different business strategies, and built animated visualizations of the simulation using folium.
