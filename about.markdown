I am a data scientist and designer working at [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com) in Chicago and occasional [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org) volunteer. I'm interested in using data and simulations to grok systemic challenges and solutions. I want to help build a better and more equitable world, particularly one that isn't completely ravaged by the devastating effects of climate change. 


Some examples of work I've contributed to you can find on the internet:
 - [Building a laugh detector](https://www.ideo.com/blog/why-your-office-needs-a-laugh-detector) Building a fitbit for laughter to understand group cohesion and creativity
 - [Neural Knitworks](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/AlkaPalka/neural-knitworks-sweater) Generating knitting patterns using neural networks
 - [Understanding data quality for frontline health workers](https://www.datakind.org/blog/engineering-scalable-data-quality-assessments-for-frontline-health) Case study of a DataKind project I worked on
 - [Nanodiamond research](https://phys.org/news/2016-06-tiny-diamonds-enable-huge-advances.html) Write up of work from my past life as a physicist


I also make art and music that has nothing to do with data or science:
