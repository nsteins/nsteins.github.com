I am a data scientist and designer working at [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com) in Chicago and occasional [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org) volunteer. I'm interested in using data and simulations to grok systemic challenges and solutions. I want to help build a better and more equitable world, particularly one that isn't completely ravaged by the devastating effects of climate change. 

I'm also a lapsed physicist, Carly Rae Jepsen fanatic and aspiring emo musician.
